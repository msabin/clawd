Important Questions
Answers
Why This Matters:
What is the overall 
deductible?
In-Network: Individual $750 / Family $1,500. 
Out-of-Network: Individual $2,250 / Family $4,500.
Generally, you must pay all of the costs from providers up to the deductible amount 
before this plan begins to pay. If you have other family members on the plan, each 
family member must meet their own individual deductible until the total amount of 
deductible expenses paid by all family members meets the overall family deductible.
Are there services
covered before you meet
your deductible?
Yes. Emergency care &amp; prescription drugs; plus 
in-network office visits &amp; preventive care are covered 
before you meet your deductible.
This plan covers some items and services even if you haven’t yet met the deductible 
amount. But a copayment or coinsurance may apply. For example, this plan covers 
certain preventive services without cost sharing and before you meet your deductible. 
See a list of covered preventive services at 
https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/.
Are there other
deductibles for specific
services?
No.
You don’t have to meet deductibles for specific services.
What is the out-of-pocket
limit for this plan?
In-Network: Individual $3,000 / Family $6,000. 
Out-of-Network: Individual $8,000 / Family $16,000.
The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered services. If you 
have other family members in this plan, they have to meet their own out-of-pocket 
limits until the overall family out-of-pocket limit has been met.
What is not included in
the out-of-pocket limit?
Premiums, balance-billing charges, health care this 
plan doesn't cover &amp; penalties for failure to obtain 
pre-authorization for services.
Even though you pay these expenses, they don’t count toward the out-of-pocket limit.
Will you pay less if you
use a network provider?
Yes. See http://www.aetna.com/docfind or call 
1-866-208-5994 for a list of in-network providers. 
This plan uses a provider network. You will pay less if you use a provider in the plan’s 
network. You will pay the most if you use an out-of-network provider, and you might 
receive a bill from a provider for the difference between the provider's charge and what 
your plan pays (balance billing). Be aware, your network provider might use an 
out-of-network provider for some services (such as lab work). Check with your provider 
before you get services.
Do you need a referral to
see a specialist?
No.
You can see the specialist you choose without a referral.
